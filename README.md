• Designed a high-power RF amplifier PCB module that is intended for use in a satellite communication transmitter at 11 GHz.

• Specifications: The module is capable of delivering up to 44 dBm output power, Power Added Efficiency (PAE) in the range of 15 to 25 percent and a P1DB of 23dBm.

• Utilized a high-performance Wolfspeed GaN-on-SiC MMIC (CMPA601C025F), selected for its ability to operate efficiently at Ku-band frequencies with high output power and linearity.

• Designed on RT/duroid® 6010 high-frequency laminate (Dk=10.2) to ensure characteristic impedance of the input and output microstrip transmission line, low dielectric loss and stable performance at 11 GHz.

• Included instructions for the PCB manufacturer to drill a PCB cavity beneath the IC footprint to meet physical dimensions and thermal management requirements of the GaN device, ensuring efficient heat transfer and mechanical stability.

• With a module like this is possible to achieve a received power of -103.26 dBm in a receiver station that is at 1000 km assuming a transmitter antenna with a gain of 10dBi, a transmitted power of 30 dBm, a receiver antenna gain of 30 dBi at 11 GHz.
