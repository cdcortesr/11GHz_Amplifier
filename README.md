# RF Power Amplifier PCB Design for Satellite Transmitter (11 GHz, 44 dBm Output)

• Designed a high-power RF amplifier PCB to deliver 44 dBm output at 11 GHz, intended for use in a satellite communication transmitter.

• Utilized a high-performance Wolfspeed GaN-on-SiC MMIC (CMPA601C025F), selected for its ability to operate efficiently at Ku-band frequencies with high output power and linearity.

• Designed on RT/duroid® 6010 high-frequency laminate to ensure low dielectric loss and stable performance at 11 GHz.

• Engineered a precision-machined PCB cavity beneath the IC footprint to meet the thermal management requirements of the GaN device, ensuring efficient heat transfer and mechanical stability.

• Implemented controlled-impedance microstrip transmission lines.
